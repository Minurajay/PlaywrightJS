/*Initial article count: 9
When the page first loaded, it found 9 articles

New article count: 9
This is the first check after scrolling, showing no new articles yet
This is normal as there might be a slight delay before new content loads

New article count: 18
After waiting a bit longer, the count increased to 18 articles
This shows that lazy loading successfully worked
The number of articles doubled, suggesting a batch of 9 new articles was loaded

1 passed (4.3s)
The test passed because it met our expectations
It proved that lazy loading is working as intended
The entire test took 4.3 seconds to complete

This is a successful test result because:
It confirmed the lazy loading functionality is working
More articles were loaded after scrolling (9 â†’ 18)
The loading happened within our 3-second timeout window*/
